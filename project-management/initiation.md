### Requirement
- Who informs me: supervisor
- aims & objectives
  
  To Extending the Quando Visual Toolset for non-programmers with web based AI(TensorFlow.js)

  Desgin Game Controls
  filter the signal strength depends on time/speed.
  
  for example: mapping triger to keyboard W key, use the angle of the handle trigger press to represent the frequency of keyboard keys.

  use Quando inventor to create block to extend toolsets

- measurable outcomes
  
  From previous dissertation project, quando toolset has been extend with IBM Waston(AI conversation). and EEG headset driven Interactions.

  Extending toolset for AI-enhanced AR Games?

### Types of project
- Design, build & test
- Experimental
- Theoretical

### Constraints
- Project description
- Survey and analysis
- Final dissertation


### Abstract

This project is for extends the quando with map gamepad controld to keyboard by using Quando inventor.

enhanced game controls 

Intent Communication
-  the Game controls should communicate the player's intent in a way the palyer expects and create a feeling of full control.
-  Signal Filtering (*)
-  After the player sent the input signal, the system should process it, Here, we have a contradiction: players usually expect that the system should do _**approximately**_ what they want, but controller sends precise input to the system.
